For example, you can change the widget's position, color, and more. To do so, you can add any of the following configuration and text options to the plugin or formatted as camelCase. Here's an example: plugins: [ [ 'docusaurus-pushfeedback',{ project: '&lt;YOUR_PROJECT_ID&gt;', buttonPosition: 'center-right', modalPosition: 'sidebar-right', buttonStyle: 'dark', modalTitle: 'Share your thoughts' } ] ],  To further customize the style of the Biel.ai widget in Docusaurus, such as altering the widget's background color, you can override specific CSS properties. This is done by defining these properties in a custom stylesheet. Here's how you can do it: In your project's src directory, create the file css/custom.css. In the custom.css file, you can define your custom CSS properties. For example, to change the widget's primary color, add the following CSS rule: :root { --feedback-primary-color: #FF0000; /* Replace #FF0000 with the hex color code of your choice */ } For a complete reference of properties you can modify, see the Styles documentation. Open your docusaurus.config.js file and locate the presets array and within it, the classic preset configuration. Then, add a reference to your custom stylesheet in the theme configuration. It should look something like this: presets: [ [ 'classic', { // ... other configurations ... theme: { customCss: require.resolve('./src/css/custom.css'), // Add this line }, // ... other configurations ... }, ], ],  "},{"title":"AI chatbot for Jekyll","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/installation/jekyll","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Prerequisites​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AI chatbot for Jekyll","url":"/installation/jekyll#prerequisites","content":"Before you begin, you'll need to have the following: A Biel.ai account.
