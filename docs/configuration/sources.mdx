# Sources

In Biel.ai, you can configure various types of sources to index content for your chatbot to reference.
These sources allow the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the content you want to make accessible. Each source type serves different needs, depending on the scope of content you want to index.

This guide will explain the different source types, when to use them, and how to configure each.

## Source Types

### 1. **URL Sources (Single pages)**

**When to use:**  
Use this method when you want to index specific individual web pages. It's ideal for cases where you need the chatbot to reference a particular piece of content, such as a blog post, article, or landing page.

- **Example:** You want to index your FAQ page, a product description page, or a particular blog post.

**Key points:**
- Best for single-page indexing.
- Not suitable for indexing an entire website.

### 2. **Sitemap Sources (Complete websites)**

**When to use:**  
If you need to index an entire website or multiple pages at once, use the sitemap method. Sitemaps are XML files that contain a list of all the pages on your website, allowing Biel.ai to automatically crawl and index them.

- **Example:** You want to index all the pages on your website or all blog posts listed in a sitemap.

**Key points:**
- Ideal for large websites with multiple pages.
- Supports nested sitemaps, allowing comprehensive indexing of large sites.
- Sitemaps must end with `.xml`.

If you plan to index an entire website or a large number of pages, **using a sitemap is recommended** to ensure efficient and thorough indexing.

### 3. **File Sources (Coming Soon)**

**When to use:**  
This feature will allow you to upload and index various document formats, such as PDFs, Word documents, and text files. It will be useful when you want the chatbot to reference information from static documents.

- **Example:** Upload a product manual in PDF format or a terms and conditions document.

**Key points:**
- File formats will include PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, and text files.
- This feature is currently under development and will be available soon.
