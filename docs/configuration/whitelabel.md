1. Open [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai).

2. Log in using your account credentials.

3. Once inside the dashboard, click on the **Teams** link in the top navigation bar.

4. Within the Teams settings, look for the **Whitelabel** option. Activate this option to enable white labeling.

5. Click the **Save** button to apply your changes.

6. To ensure the changes are in place, go to any webpage where you've implemented the Biel.ai widget. The Biel.ai logo should no longer be visible.
