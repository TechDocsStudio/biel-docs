# Whitelabel

:::info
This feature is only available on the [Professional](https://biel.ai#pricing) and [Unlimited](https://biel.ai#pricing) plans.
:::

Biel.ai offers a white labeling option which allows you to hide the Biel.ai logo from the bottom of the chatbot, ensuring a seamless experience for your users.

## Steps

Follow the steps below to enable this feature:

1. Open [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai).

2. Log in using your account credentials.

3. Once inside the dashboard, click on the **Teams** link in the top navigation bar.

4. Within the Teams settings, look for the **Whitelabel** option. Activate this option to enable white labeling.

5. Save your settings by clicking the **Save** button.

6. To ensure the changes are in place, go to any webpage where you've implemented the Biel.ai widget. The Biel.ai logo should no longer be visible at the bottom of the widget.

With the logo removed, your chatbot will seamlessly blend with your website, providing a consistent user experience.
