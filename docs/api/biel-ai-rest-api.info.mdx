## Authorization
Biel API uses API key authentication for secure access to private projects. If your project is marked as private, you'll need to include an API key in your requests. For public projects, no authentication is required.

To get your API key:

1. Log in to your Biel account at [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai)
2. Navigate to Team Settings
3. Find the API Key section
4. Copy your API key

Include your API key in the Authorization header for all API requests to private projects:
```
Authorization: <your-api-key>
```

Note: Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate it in the Team Settings.
