# Models

Biel.ai offers a range of AI models designed to enhance user interactions with your documentation site. These models provide different levels of performance, speed, and sophistication, enabling you to select the best fit for your needs.

## Available AI models

Biel.ai supports the following models:

- **GPT-4o Mini (default)**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.  
- **GPT-4**: Advanced capabilities for detailed and complex queries.  
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Fast and effective for general documentation.  
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Designed for nuanced, context-rich answers.  

## Choosing the right model

To select the best model for your needs, consider the following factors:

| **Factor**              | **Fast Models (GPT-4o Mini, Claude 3.5 Haiku)**       | **Advanced Models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Response speed**       | Prioritizes speed for real-time responsiveness.       | Slightly slower, with a focus on depth and accuracy. |
| **Content complexity**   | Ideal for straightforward or moderately complex content. | Best for highly technical, specialized, or detailed content. |
| **Plan eligibility**     | Available on all plans.                               | Requires **Business** or higher plans.        |
| **Traffic considerations** | Suitable for high-traffic sites due to lower cost.     | Recommended for sites with focused, high-value queries. |

### GPT vs. Claude

When deciding between GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, consider your organization's preferences and the style of responses you expect. GPT-4 models are known for their technical depth, while Claude 3.5 often delivers responses with a conversational and empathetic tone. Testing both models against your use case can help identify which aligns better with your documentation needs.
