# Sources

Configure sources to provide content for your chatbot and search widget. Sources determine what information your AI can access to answer questions.

:::important  
Only **Administrator** and **Maintainer** roles can manage sources. See [Manage roles](../administration/roles.md).  
:::

## Choose a source type

### URLs
Index individual web pages like blog posts or landing pages.

For multiple pages, use sitemaps instead.

### Sitemaps
Index entire websites using XML sitemap files. Sitemaps must end with `.xml`.

Supports nested sitemaps for large sites.

### GitHub
Index GitHub repositories directly.

- **Public repositories**: No authentication required
- **Private repositories**: Requires GitHub token
- **File filtering**: Control which files to include or exclude

Files remain private—widgets won't expose file links as sources.

### Files
Upload documents in these formats: PDF, CSV, Excel, Word, TXT, MD.

Files remain private—widgets won't expose file links as sources.

## Add a source

1. Go to [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai)
2. Select **Projects** > your project > **Settings**
3. In **Sources**, choose your source type:

   * **URLs**: Enter the complete web page URL
   
   * **Sitemaps**: Enter the sitemap URL ending in `.xml`
   
   * **GitHub**: Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
     
     For **private repositories**:
     1. Generate a GitHub personal access token with `repo` permissions
     2. In **Advanced options**, enter your GitHub token
     
     **Filter files** (optional):
     - **Include patterns**: `*.md, docs/, README.md`
     - **Exclude patterns**: `*.log, node_modules/, .git/`
   
   * **Files**: Upload documents directly

4. Click **Save**

Your content will be indexed automatically. Test by asking your chatbot about the indexed content.

## Filter URLs

Restrict which URLs your chatbot can access using include/exclude patterns.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Sources** > **Restrictions** > **Filter URLs**
2. Add patterns:
   - **Exclude** `/es`: Skip URLs containing `/es`
   - **Include** `/docs`: Only index URLs containing `/docs`
   - **Exclude** `^https://example.com/old/.*$`: Skip the `/old/` path (regex)
3. Click **Save**
