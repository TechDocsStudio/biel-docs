# Sources

In Biel.ai, you can configure various types of sources to index content for your chatbot to reference.
These sources allow the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the content you want to make accessible. Each source type serves different needs, depending on the scope of content you want to index.

This guide will explain the different source types, when to use them, and how to configure each.

## Source types

### 1. URLs

Use this method when you want to index specific **individual web pages**. 
It's ideal for cases where you need the chatbot to reference a particular piece of content, such as a blog post, article, or landing page.

**Key points:**
- Best for single-page indexing.
- Not suitable for indexing an entire website. If you plan to index an entire website or a large number of pages, **using a sitemap is recommended**.

### 2. Sitemaps

If you need to index an **entire website** or multiple pages at once, use the sitemap method.
Sitemaps are XML files that contain a list of all the pages on your website, allowing Biel.ai to automatically crawl and index them.

**Key points:**
- Ideal for large websites with multiple pages.
- Supports nested sitemaps, allowing comprehensive indexing of large sites.
- Sitemaps must end with `.xml`.

### 3. Files (coming soon)

This feature allows you to upload and index various document formats, such as PDFs, Excels, and text files. 
It is useful when you want the chatbot to reference information from static documents.

**Key points:**
- File formats accepted include `.pdf`, `.word`, `.csv`, `.xls` and any text file.
- Files remain private and only accessible by the chatbot to generate responses.
- Widgets will not expose link to the files as sources or search results.
- This feature is currently under development and will be available soon.

## Configuring sources
