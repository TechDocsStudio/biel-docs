# Suggested questions

Biel.ai allows you to configure suggested questionsâ€”predefined prompts that appear to users when they interact with the chatbot. These are typically FAQs or common queries designed to guide users without them needing to type their questions.

This guide will show you how to set up and customize suggested questions for your chatbot.
