# URLs

Add individual web pages to your project. Use URLs when you need specific pages rather than entire websites.

:::tip
For multiple pages from the same website, use [sitemaps](sitemaps.md) instead.
:::

## When to use URLs

Use URLs to:
- Add specific pages from different websites
- Test new content before adding full sites
- Include only high-priority pages from larger sites
- Add pages that aren't in sitemaps

## Requirements

URLs must be:
- Publicly accessible (not behind login)
- Include the protocol (`https://`)
- Contain searchable text content

## Add URLs

1. Go to [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai)
2. Select **Projects** > your project > **Settings** > **Sources**
3. Select **URLs**
4. Enter the complete URL (including `https://`)
5. Click **Save**

Example URLs:
```
https://example.com/blog/getting-started
https://docs.example.com/api-reference
https://support.example.com/troubleshooting
```

## Best practices

- Use canonical URLs (primary version of each page)
- Start with 10-20 key pages
- Test one URL at a time initially
- Use sitemaps for multiple related pages

## Troubleshooting

**URL not indexing**
- Check that the URL is publicly accessible
- Verify the URL format includes `https://`
- Check if the site blocks crawlers in robots.txt

**Content not appearing**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for processing
- Test with specific questions about page content
- Check if the page uses dynamic JavaScript content

**Need help?** Contact support at [support@biel.ai](mailto:support@biel.ai) if you experience issues with content processing or indexing takes too long.
