## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- A Biel.ai account. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.biel.ai/accounts/signup/).
- A project created in your Biel.ai dashboard. If you haven't created one yet, follow the steps in the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md#2-create-a-project) guide.
- An Astro project.

## Installation

To integrate the Biel.ai widget into your Astro site:

1. Open your Astro project in your preferred code editor.

1. Locate the `src/layouts/Layout.astro` file (or any layout file that wraps your pages) and insert the following code within the `<head>` section:

    ```html
    <!-- Initialize the Biel.ai widget -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/biel-search/dist/biel-search/biel-search.css">
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/biel-search/dist/biel-search/biel-search.esm.js"></script>
    ```

1. Just before the closing `</body>` tag of your layout file, add the following snippet:

    ```html
    <biel-button project="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" 
        header-title="Biel.ai chatbot"
        button-position="bottom-right"
        modal-position="bottom-right"
        button-style="dark">
            Ask AI
    </biel-button>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID from the [Biel.ai dashboard](../quickstart.md#2-create-a-project).

1. Open the website in a web browser to verify the chatbot appears and works correctly.
