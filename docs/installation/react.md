# AI chat widget for React

Add an AI chatbot to your React application using Biel.ai's React components. The integration works with both functional and class components, and is compatible with Create React App, Vite, and other common React setups.

This guide shows you how to install the package via NPM and add the chat widget to your React components in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A **Biel.ai account**. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.biel.ai/accounts/signup/).
- **A project created in your Biel.ai dashboard**. Follow the [Quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) to create one.
- **A React application** ready to install Biel.ai.  
- **Node.js** installed.

## Installation

The Biel.AI chat widget enables a conversational chat powered by AI in your site.

To integrate the Biel.AI chat widget into your site:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to your project's root directory using the `cd` command:

    ```console
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
    
    Replace `path/to/your/project` with your project's actual directory path.

1. With your terminal still open, run the following command to install Biel.ai:

    ```console
    npm install biel-react
    ```

    :::info
    If you're using yarn as your package manager, run `yarn add biel-react` instead of the npm command above.
    :::

1. In the main component where you wish to place the chatbot (often `src/App.js`), embed the Biel.ai button:

    ```ts
    import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

    import { BielButton } from 'biel-react';
    import { defineCustomElements } from 'biel-search/loader';
    import 'biel-search/dist/biel-search/biel-search.css';

    function App() {
        
        useEffect(() => {
            if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
            defineCustomElements(window);
            }
        }, []);

        return (
            <div className="App">
                {/* Other components and content */}
                <BielButton project="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" 
                    header-title="Biel.ai chatbot"
                    button-position="bottom-right"
                    modal-position="bottom-right"
                    button-style="dark">Ask AI
                </BielButton>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID from the [Biel.ai dashboard](../quickstart.md#2-create-a-project).

1. Start your React app by running `npm start` or `yarn start` in your terminal. Once it compiles successfully, verify that the chatbot  appears and functions correctly on your site.
