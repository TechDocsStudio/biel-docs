# AI chatbot for Jekyll

Biel.ai is an advanced chatbot designed to transform the way users interact with your technical documentation.
By leveraging AI, Biel.ai delivers instant, context-rich answers, making your documentation more accessible and reducing the need for repetitive support tasks.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install Biel.ai in your Jekyll project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A **Biel.ai account**. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.biel.ai/accounts/signup/).
- **A project created in your Biel.ai dashboard**. Follow the [Quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) to create one.
- **A Jekyll application** ready to install Biel.ai.  

## Installation

The Biel.ai widget enables a conversational chat powered by AI in your site.

To integrate the Biel.ai widget into your Jekyll site:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to your project's root directory using the `cd` command:

    ```console
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
    
    Replace `path/to/your/project` with your project's actual directory path.

1. Open the `_includes/head.html` file (or the equivalent file that contains the `<head>` section in your Jekyll theme). Append the following code:

    ```html
    <!-- Initialize the Biel.ai widget -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/biel-search/dist/biel-search/biel-search.css">
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/biel-search/dist/biel-search/biel-search.esm.js"></script>
    ```

1. Open `_includes/footer.html` or the specific file where you'd like the chatbot to appear. Add the following snippet just before its closing tags:

    ```html
    <biel-button project="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" 
        header-title="Biel.ai chatbot"
        button-position="bottom-right"
        modal-position="bottom-right"
        button-style="dark">
            Ask AI
    </biel-button>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID from the [Biel.ai dashboard](../quickstart.md#2-create-a-project).

1. After making these changes, navigate back to your Jekyll project root and run:

    ```console
    jekyll build
    ```

    Once it builds successfully, verify that the chatbot  appears and functions correctly on your site.
