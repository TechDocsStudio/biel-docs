    ## Authorization & permissions

    Biel.ai REST API uses a granular permission system with API key authentication. The access requirements depend on whether your project is public or private:

    ### Public projects
    - **Read operations** (like searching, getting project details) don't require authentication
    - **Write operations** (like uploading sources, creating chats) always require a valid API key with appropriate permissions

    ### Private projects
    - All operations require a valid API key with appropriate permissions

    > **Note:** You can configure whether your project is public or private in **Project settings**. Projects are public by default.

    ### Available permissions

    When creating an API key, you can assign specific permissions:

    | Permission | Description | Required For |
    |------------|-------------|--------------|
    | `project_read` | Read project details | Getting project information |
    | `project_search` | Search documents within projects | Searching project content, tracking search clicks |
    | `project_sources_read` | View project sources | Listing project sources (files, URLs, sitemaps) |
    | `project_sources_create` | Upload sources | Adding files, URLs, and sitemaps to projects |
    | `project_sources_delete` | Delete sources | Removing sources from projects |
    | `project_sync` | Refresh/sync project data | Triggering project data refresh |
    | `chat_create` | Create chats and send messages | Interacting with the AI chat |

    ### Creating an API Key

    1. Log in to your Biel account at [app.biel.ai](https://app.biel.ai).
    2. Navigate to **Team**.
    3. Scroll to the **API Keys** section.
    4. Click **Create API Key**.
    5. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Frontend App", "Data Sync Service").
    6. Select the specific permissions you need:
       - **Read only:** Select `project_read`, `project_search`, `project_sources_read` for read-only access.
       - **Read & write:** Add `project_sources_create`, `project_sources_delete`, `project_sync`, `chat_create` for full access.
       - **Custom:** Choose specific permissions based on your needs.
    7. Click **Create API Key**.
    8. **Important:** Copy the API key immediately - you won't be able to view it again.

    ### Using your API key

    Include your API key in the Authorization header for all API requests:
    ```
    Authorization: Api-Key <your-api-key>
    ```

    **Security notes:**
    - Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly.
    - Use environment variables to store API keys in your applications.
    - Assign only the minimum permissions needed for your use case.
    - If compromised, regenerate your API key immediately in Team Settings.

    > **Note:** If your use case involves only search or read operations, you can expose an API keys with read-only permissions when necessary. However, always keep keys with write access private.
